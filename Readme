This is a project to complete the classification of the mnist dataset with an RNN.
The API used in this project is the basical API of tensorflow.
It includs three modules.
Input data:cited from tensorflow's tourial
        from tensorflow.examples.tutorials.mnist import input_data
        mnist=input_data.read_data_sets("You Should Change It to You Own Dir",one_hot=True)
        #Returned mnist is a object,including mnist.train and mnist.test subobjects which have method next_batch

Reference:including
    lazy_property:a decorator make the function used like a property of the RNN.
    reference:a class defines the structure of the network;including input,forward,loss,train,evaluate AND A WRITER.
main:A test code.
